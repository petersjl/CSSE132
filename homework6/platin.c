/**
 * Here's the main function for our program.  Put all your code in here unless
 * you want to make a helper function.
 *
 * WARNING: there are no tests provided for this program.  You'll have to test
 * it by making and running platin and checking what it does.
 *
 * This program runs in two modes:
 * 1. If there are arguments, convert and print them.
 * 2. If there are no arguments, read input and convert
 *    each line of input.
 *
 * WE RECOMMEND YOU IMPLEMENT THE FIRST MODE, TEST IT, THEN ADD SUPPORT FOR THE
 * SECOND ONE.
 *
 * Mode 1: if there are arguments (that means argc is greater than 1),
 * your program should print the pig-latin version of each argument, one per
 * line.  Mode 1 example:
 *    [foo@pi]$ ./platin awesome sauce
 *    awesomeyay
 *    aucesay
 *    [foo@pi]$
 *
 * Mode 2: If there are no arguments, read lines of input using fgets and pigify
 * each line. Be sure to remove the newline character from each line by converting
 * it to a null character.
 *   ASSUME there is only one word per line.
 *
 * In this example for Mode 2 below, a + means it was typed, and a - means the
 * program printed it. The last line of input is just the enter key):
 *    [foo@pi]$ ./platin
 * +  awesome
 * -  awesomeyay
 * +  sauce
 * -  aucesay
 * +  foo
 * -  oofay
 * +
 *    [foo@pi]$
 *
 *
 * HINT: look at the manual page for fgets(): 'man 3 fgets'.  It will read code
 *       into a buffer.  You can use fgets() with stdin by creating an array of
 *       chars on the stack, then telling fgets to read input from stdin into
 *       that array.
 *
 *       ASSUME the input will never be bigger than 100 characters.
 *
 * HINT: use your functions from problems.c.  The include statement at the top
 *       of this file makes them available (do not copy and paste them into this
 *       file.
 *
 *
 * @param argc - the number of arguments to this program
 *               (including the program name)
 * @param argv - an array of strings representing the arguments, where argv[0] is
 *               the name of the program you're running.
 * @return 0. Just return 0.

  // stop reading and return.
